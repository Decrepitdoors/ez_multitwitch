# ez_multitwitch
Easily open all the streams you want from your following page

Pin the extension for easier access!

---

Right click on a stream on Twitch

Click 'add to multitwitch' in the context menu, a number should appear infront of the extension icon

Do this again for all the streams you want to add 

Click the extension icon and click open multitwitch in the popup

Prevention from adding the same one to the list, incase your heads as empty as mine

Features I want to add:

- adding streams to an already open multitwitch tab
- better icon
- remove accidental adds? (maybe just a reset for the variable)
- maybe list them in the popup so you can remove any you added by miztake
